# Reg_Form_submission
A Registration Form, which will take data from user and store it on database(Mysql).  
In this short project i have created a index.html, styles.css, validate.js and register.php script.
Via html i created the page and used css to style it. used javascript to validate the correct format of the form and it's fields (like 1st name can't be less than 6 digit, ph no should be 10 like that.)
php i have used to interact with database so the details user enter via form can be submitted to the database. for database i am using Apache (xampp server) and mysql.
